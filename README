	 DIM server
	============

Little thing to fork&exec and kill ucesb for recording data via DIM commands.

Example invocation:
export DIM_DNS_HOSTNAME=localhost # Defaults to pccore21.
export DIM_DNS_PORT=2000          # Defaults to 2505.
export LMD_DEST=/data/201804      # No default, must be set!
./actar
./compass

The heart beats implemented by Ondrej Subrt are kept.

compass.cc will cycle run open/close to make actar.cc take lots of runs with
UCESB. The run start and run number are atomic to make sure they are in sync by
sending "StartRun <number>", run stop is simply "StopRun".

actar.cc provides the run number of the current run being taken by UCESB as
"ActarRunNumber", and sends 0 otherwise.
