	 DIM server
	============

Little thing to fork&exec and kill ucesb to recorde ACTAR data via DIM
commands.

Example invocation:
$ export DIM_DNS_HOSTNAME=localhost           # Defaults to pccore21.
$ export DIM_DNS_PORT=2000                    # Defaults to 2505.
$ export DIM_LMD_PATH=/data/201804            # No default, must be set!
$ export DIM_LOG_PATH=/data/201804/runlog.txt # This too!
$ ./actar
To test, set similar env vars in another terminal and:
$ ./compass

The heart beats implemented by Ondrej Subrt have been kept.

compass.cc will cycle run open/close to make actar.cc take lots of runs with
UCESB. The run start request and run number are atomic to make sure they are in
sync by sending "StartRun <number>", run stop is simply "StopRun".

actar.cc provides the run number of the current run being taken by UCESB as
"ActarRunNumber", and sends 0 otherwise (i.e. would be best if run numbers
start from 1), this way one can see from the outside that files are
started/stopped according to requests. Every run start/stop is also logged to
DIM_LOG_PATH with the dlpc144 local time (should it be GMT?).
